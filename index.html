  <h1> Software Entropy </h1>
  <p>The section that speaks the most to me from chapter 1 is the section on Software Entropy. I really liked this section and it spoke to me because it talks about maintaining projects and not letting them waste away. I really liked the simple analogy the authors used, where they compared software rot/faulty code to a broken window. I really liked this analogy because it helped me understand that when people leave a project alone with a broken window, it needs to be repaired/boarded up quickly, otherwise the whole project could be doomed. These “broken windows” are good indicators of software rot, and we need to take care of them before they accelerate the rotting process. I think this is a very good mindset to have because it allows you to take care of your code and not let it fall to ruin. It is a good idea to always be checking your code, so you don’t get one big crash at the end and realize there are a big number of problems with your code. </p> 
  <p>Another part of the Software Entropy was the emphasis 	the entire section placed on winning against entropy and the whole mindset aspect they talk about. I think it is super important to be in a happy/fresh headspace while coding because it helps keep you attentive to errors you might miss if you are tired, sad, angry, etc. This will help with maintaining your code and preventing you from making errors, which the book notes is a good way to prevent entropy/scrapping your project. If you are working in a group, then you really don’t want to be the first one to make a mistake or ruin the code. That is why you need to have a fresh/happy mindset while coding, instead of an angry/frustrated mindset. </p>
